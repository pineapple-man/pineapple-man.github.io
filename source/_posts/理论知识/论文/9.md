## 进展

本两周主要确定下来几件事情：

1. 终于完成了开题报告的书写，以及开题 PPT 的制作:joy:，接下来要潜心读论文，做实验、想创新点了

## 论文笔记

### :one: Federated Transfer Learning for Bearing Fault Diagnosis Based on Averaging Shared Layers

Therefore, how to effectively use the separated data of multiple participants to jointly train a reliable intelligent fault diagnosis model is an urgent challenge.

In the field of machinery fault diagnosis, there are few applications of federated learning. This paper main contribution is:

1) A FTL_ASL fault diagnosis method is proposed
2) A new initialization method motivated by transfer learning is developed

#### research questions

In a word, there are two core chanllenges in actual scenario to be considered:

1. Insufficient labeled data is available to train a fault diagnosis model for one certain data owner. What’s more, it’s illegal to put the data from different sources together due to the data security and privacy 「data privacy」
2. Different client (diagnosis tasks), whose data are usually conllected in different working conditions and even from different devices so that it’s hard to train a model that could fit all client 「model generalization」

#### hypotheses

Different participants, whose datasets and corresponding tasks are variant with each other, train a global model collaboratively and obtain the most suitable model for its task.

The research is developed based on the these assumptions:

1. The local dataset of different clients can’t be accessed by theother clients, which ensures the data privacy
2. The data distributions are variant with different clients beacause the data is collected by different devices and under  different working conditions. Besides, the data scale is small.
3. The fault diagnosis tasks are variant with each client which allow different clients to build their own fault diagnosis model

#### method/measures used

a modified federated averaging method based on shared layers is adopted to implement federated averaging of distributed feature layers from different diagnosis models, and personalized layers are updated locally



### :two: Research on federated learning method for fault diagnosis in multiple working conditions

虽然深度学习在滚动轴承故障诊断中有一定的应用价值，但对多工况下的轴承故障诊断存在一定的困难



### :three: Federated learning for machinery fault diagnosis with dynamic validation and self-supervision

使用联邦学习用于解决故障诊断问题的一篇论文

#### research questions

Data-driven machinery fault diagnosis methods have been successfully and popularly developed in the past years. 

:cry: While promising diagnostic performance has been achieved, the existing methods generally require large amounts of high-quality supervised data for training, which are mostly difficult and expensive to collect in real industries

:bulb:it is motivated that the distributed data of multiple clients can be integrated and exploited to build a powerful data-driven model. 

:cry: integrated and exploited to build a powerful data-driven model base on multiple client, requires data sharing among different users, and is not preferred in most industries cases due to potential conflict of interest.

:dart: in order to address the data island problem, a federated learning method for machinery fault diagnosis is proposed in this paper.

:question: 数据驱动的故障诊断方法依赖于高质量的有标签数据，然后现有的单厂商数据并不能很好的解决数据问题。最简单的方法就是整合多个厂商的数据进行统一训练，然而这样会引入数据隐私问题，所以想要获得更多的数据，需要安全的联合多个厂商的数据。另一方面，联合多个厂商的数据之后，可能现有的方法并不起作用，所以还需要基于现有的方法，在多厂商的情况下，进行故障诊断。

#### method/measures used

- Proposes a federated learning method for machinery fault diagnosis with dynamic validation and self-supervised learning.

model training is locally implemented within earch participated client, and self-supervised learning shceme is proposed to enhance the learning performance.

The server aggregates the locally updated models in each training round under the dynamic validation scheme, and a global fault diagnosis model can be established.


## 额外补充的知识

:thinking:到底什么是横向，什么是纵向联邦学习？

作为并不是专门研究联邦学习的人员而言，联邦学习对我而言，更多是一种安全多方训练机器学习的框架而已。由于，联邦学习对于不同的场景拥有不同的处理方法，对症下药能够取得较好的作用，所以人为的根据各个参与方的数据划分状态，分为横向联邦和纵向联邦，其中横向联邦更加偏重理想状态的假设，纵向联邦场景更适用于实际应用。值得注意的是，横向与纵向的划分并不是为了分裂联邦学习为两个内容，而是为了首先对于不同的场景专注研究，所有将不同场景的方法进行混合，也许就能处理更加复杂且真实场景（横纵向混合联邦学习场景）
