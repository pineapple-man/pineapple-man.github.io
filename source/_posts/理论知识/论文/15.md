### :one: In Search of an Understandable Consensus Algorithm (Extended Version)

What is raft?/What problem its want to solved?

- Raft is a consensus algorithm for managing a replicated log.

Raft separates the key elements of consensus,such as leader election,log replication, and safety, and it enforces a stronger defree of coherency to reduce the number of states that must be considered.

Raft is similar in many ways to existing consensus algorithms,but it has several novel features:

- Strong leader.For example,log entries only flow from the leader to other servers. This simplifies the management of the replicated log and makes raft easier to understand.
- Leader election, raft uses randomized timers to elect leaders.
- Membership changes,
